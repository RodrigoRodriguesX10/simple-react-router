# simple-react-router

## Introduction

The idea behind this project is to offer a simple way to create a router in React.js, using basic concepts like URL's path matching, conditional rendering and window Location events.

As a developer I had a lot of issues with third party libraries that always releases breaking change, parameters mismatches upgrades and undesireable stuff that breaks a simple website build after an "yarn/npm start" command.

So I decide to make my own router with simple and easy to use components, easy configuration to URL pattern matching and other cool stuff that I want to use in my personal and professional projects.

## Features to release

- [ ] Conditional Component Rendering by Route
- [ ] URL path parameters
- [ ] Regex parameters validation
- [ ] Custom 404 error page
- [ ] Nested routing
- [ ] Navigation functions and components
